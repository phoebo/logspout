# Logspout

This is a component of Phoebo CI responsible for sending logs from slave hosts to application server.

It is early fork of Logspout project. **For original see: <https://github.com/gliderlabs/logspout>**

For better integration there is added option to push logs to web application through WebSockets (Original acts as WebSocket server, we use WebSocket client approach).
